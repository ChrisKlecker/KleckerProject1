# KleckerProject1
This is the repository for Project 1 of Rapid Java Development to develop a quiz using Java Beans and Netbeans. You will notice a local directory for questions. For some reason this directory is removed causes the java program to not compile. Given for time I left it there. Normally I would figure this out, but it was just easier to leave it there.
